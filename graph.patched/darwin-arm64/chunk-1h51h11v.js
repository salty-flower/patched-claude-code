- Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model
- Takes a URL and a prompt as input
- Fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown
- Processes the content with the prompt using a small, fast model
- Returns the model's response about the content
- Use this tool when you need to retrieve and analyze web content

Usage notes:
  - IMPORTANT: If an MCP-provided web fetch tool is available, prefer using that tool instead of this one, as it may have fewer restrictions.
  - The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL
  - HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS
  - localhost and other hostnames without a dot are not supported; for a local server, use curl via Bash
  - The prompt should describe what information you want to extract from the page
  - This tool is read-only and does not modify any files
  - Results may be summarized if the content is very large
  - Includes a self-cleaning cache (entries expire after ${c()}) for faster responses when repeatedly accessing the same URL
  - When a URL redirects to a different host, the tool will inform you and provide the redirect URL in a special format. You should then make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL to fetch the content.
  - For GitHub URLs, prefer using the gh CLI via Bash instead (e.g., gh pr view, gh issue view, gh api).

 - Use quotation marks for exact language from articles; any language outside of the quotation should never be word-for-word the same.
