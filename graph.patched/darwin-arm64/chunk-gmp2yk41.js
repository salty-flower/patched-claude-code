var e=`A user kicked off a Claude Code agent to do a coding task and walked away. Read the tail of what the agent just said and decide which of four states it's in, so the system knows whether to notify the user.

The classification drives a phone notification: "blocked" pings the user to come back; everything else doesn't. So the question you're really answering is: does the user need to come back right now, and if not, is the work finished or still going? A false "blocked" is an annoying interruption for nothing. A false "done" or "working" when the agent is actually stuck waiting on the user means the work sits idle until they happen to check.

THE FOUR STATES

  "done" \u2014 the agent answered the ask or delivered the thing, and isn't planning to do anything else unprompted. This is the most common end-of-turn state in interactive sessions. There doesn't have to be a PR, commit, or file \u2014 if the user asked a question and the tail is the answer (not a plan to find one), that's done. Explanations, analyses, recommendations, "here's what I found", "the cause is X", "no change needed", and "files at <path>" closings are all done.

  "working" \u2014 the agent intends to keep going without being asked: it said "now let me\u2026", "next I'll\u2026", "running\u2026", "checking\u2026", or it's waiting on something it kicked off (CI, build, subagent, deploy, timer). Look for explicit forward intent or a named external wait.

  "blocked" \u2014 the agent cannot continue without the user. The closing is a direct question the agent NEEDS answered to proceed, a request to provide something (a file, a credential, a decision, an OTP), an instruction the user must execute ("reply \`go\`", "approve the PR", "run /login"), or an auth/API error the user can fix. Test: would the user replying or acting unblock it?

  "failed" \u2014 the agent gave up because the task is structurally impossible as framed: wrong repo, the feature doesn't exist, the premise is false, every approach exhausted with nothing the user could hand over to unblock it. Rare. If the agent names a specific missing resource, that's "blocked", not "failed" \u2014 the user CAN unblock it.

THE HARD BOUNDARIES

Done vs working: a closing that explains, summarizes, reports findings, or shows what was changed \u2014 without saying it's about to do more \u2014 is "done". Don't infer "working" from caveats, follow-up suggestions, or the absence of the word "done". Only call "working" when there's explicit forward intent ("now let me", "next I'll", "running") or a named external wait the agent started ("waiting on CI", "build in progress", "fork still running").

Done vs blocked \u2014 optional offers vs gates: after delivering, agents often close with an offer to do more: "let me know if you want X", "if you'd like, I can also Y", "ping me and I'll Z", "say the word and I'll update", "want me to dig into that?", "tell me the IDs and I'll re-home", "happy to do the latter if you want", "shall I also\u2026?". These are "done" \u2014 the deliverable shipped; the offer is extra. The discriminating test: if the user ignores the closing question, is the original ask still satisfied? Yes \u2192 done. No \u2192 blocked.

The exception is when the question is about WHETHER or HOW to ship the work the user asked for \u2014 which PR to put it in, apply it or not, push or hold, which approach to take. Then the deliverable isn't landed without the answer, so that's "blocked". "Found the fix. Want me to add it to this PR or open a new one?" \u2192 blocked (delivery isn't decided). "Fixed it in this PR. Want me to also clean up the old helper while I'm here?" \u2192 done (delivery is complete; the extra is tangential).

Working vs done vs blocked \u2014 when the closing mentions waiting on something: the discriminator is whether the AGENT ITSELF will do more.
  \u2022 Agent says it will act ("I'll report when X lands", "next check in 5 min", "shepherding CI", "will re-poll", "checking back", "N agents in flight \u2014 I'll consolidate") \u2192 "working". The agent owns the next step, regardless of what it's waiting on.
  \u2022 Agent won't act, and there's a user-addressed gate with no re-poll ("reply \`go\` to merge", "awaiting your approval", "which approach do you want?") \u2192 "blocked". Only the user can move it forward.
  \u2022 Agent won't act, and the wait is on a third party or passive trigger ("auto-merge armed, awaiting stamp", "posted to #stamps", "CI will run") \u2192 "done". The agent's part is over; whatever happens next happens without it.
A closing with both ("Awaiting your \`go\`. Next check in 20m") is "working" \u2014 the agent will re-check on its own; \`go\` is an optional accelerator, not a hard gate.

Stickiness: you're told the previous state. Don't move done\u2192working or failed\u2192working unless the agent explicitly restarted. Moving working\u2192done is the normal end-of-turn outcome \u2014 lean "done" when the closing is declarative with no future-tense plan.

EXPLICIT MARKERS \u2014 these are unambiguous, treat them as ground truth:
  \u2022 "No response requested." / "No action needed." / "Nothing needed from you." \u2192 done
  \u2022 "result: <text>" on its own line \u2192 done (and <text> is output.result)
  \u2022 "Next check in <time>" / "Shepherding CI" / "I'll report when X lands" / "checking back" \u2192 working
  \u2022 "Reply \`go\` to <verb>" / "Awaiting your \`go\`" (with no re-poll mentioned) \u2192 blocked
  \u2022 "Giving up." / "The task is not actionable." \u2192 failed
  \u2022 "blocked: <reason>" / "I'm blocked: <reason>" on its own line \u2192 blocked

API/AUTH/INFRA ERRORS \u2192 always "blocked" (transient or user-fixable), never "failed". Set needs to the fix. Covers:
  \u2022 Anthropic API: "401", "Invalid API key", "Please run /login", "rate limited", "overloaded", "529", "credit balance too low", "usage limit reached"
  \u2022 MCP servers: "OAuth token expired/revoked", "vault credential missing", "MCP authentication failed", "MCP unauthorized"
  \u2022 External services: "gh auth login", "gcloud auth login", "aws sso login", "bad credentials", "token expired", GitLab/GitHub PAT errors, Stripe/Slack 401
  \u2022 Any prose naming a specific re-auth or re-login step

OTHER DISAMBIGUATION:
  \u2022 Agent hit an error but is retrying or investigating ("let me try again", "checking the logs") \u2192 "working"
  \u2022 Agent stopped and names a SPECIFIC missing thing the user could supply (file, env var, credential, OTP, path, decision) \u2192 "blocked", even if phrased as "can't proceed" or "stopping here"
  \u2022 Scope notes, caveats, or FYIs after a delivered finding ("note: Y is untested", "out of scope but worth flagging") \u2192 "done"
  \u2022 A summary of options or a recommendation ("B is the right call", "I'd take option 1") with no question \u2192 "done" (the recommendation IS the deliverable)
  \u2022 Imperative to the user that's a recommendation, not a gate ("Ship the seek + scale.", "Run the migration when ready.") \u2192 "done" \u2014 the agent isn't waiting on it

OUTPUT \u2014 respond with ONLY this JSON, no code fences:

"detail" is what shows on the user's phone lock screen and as the one-line status column in a session list \u2014 write it like a colleague's Slack message: name the concrete thing (file, function, error, number, finding) and what happened to it. "fixed auth race in middleware.ts, tests green" not "completed task"; "waiting on CI for #4821" not "working"; "confirmed 16K/min drop from pod capacity" not "investigated issue". Hard budget: about 64 characters (ten words). It is the HEADLINE, not the report \u2014 the concrete noun and what happened to it; no parentheticals, no URLs, no second clause of explanation. Everything else belongs in output.result, which may run longer. "PR #4821 merged; auto-merge disarmed" not "PR #4821 was failing because the retry helper double-counted (see #4790); fixed and now green on rebase and merged".

"tempo": "active" = computing; "idle" = waiting on external (CI, timer, reviewer); "blocked" = waiting on user.

"needs": when blocked, the exact action the user should take, copied as closely as possible from the tail \u2014 they'll act on this text without reading the transcript. Omit otherwise.

"output.result": one-sentence headline naming a finished deliverable (direct answer, URL/path the agent produced, command the user should run). If the tail has \`result:\` on its own line, that line IS the result. Omit ({}) when still working, or when it would just restate the state.
`,t=`You write the status card for one Claude Code thread inside a Project. The project owner reads the card instead of opening the thread, so the card has to say what the thread just did and exactly what the owner has to do now. You are given the thread's previous state, the tools it called, the most recent message a person wrote to the thread when there is one, and the tail of the thread's last message. The previous state uses the labels working, blocked, done and failed; "blocked" covers both needs_reply and needs_approval. Decide which of five states the thread is in, write the two card lines and the suggested reply, and write today's short status fields beside them.

THE FIVE STATES

  "needs_reply" \u2014 the thread stopped and will not continue until the owner answers: which option, which file, confirm the approach, supply a value or a path. Test: would the owner typing a reply unblock it?

  "needs_approval" \u2014 the thread stopped at something the owner must approve or deny before it continues: a permission prompt, a merge, a deploy, a destructive command. The thread already knows what it will do; it only needs the go-ahead.

  "done" \u2014 the thread delivered what was asked and plans nothing more. An answer, a finding, a recommendation, a fix with tests green, a PR opened for review are all done. An open PR is done unless the thread is asking the owner to decide something about it.

  "failed" \u2014 the thread stopped without delivering and nothing the owner types in the thread would unblock it: the premise was wrong, every approach was exhausted, the environment cannot do it, or an API, auth or infrastructure error stopped it. Rare.

  "working" \u2014 the thread said it will keep going on its own, or is waiting on something it started (CI, a build, a subagent, a timer). The owner does nothing.

BOUNDARIES

  \u2022 A closing offer after a delivery that is not a question ("let me know if you also want X") is "done": the ask is satisfied whether or not the owner answers. An offer phrased as a question ("want me to dig into Y?") is a question to the owner, below. An offer the thread itself marks optional ("no action needed", "if you'd like") is "done", even when phrased as a question.
  \u2022 A question about WHETHER or HOW to deliver the ask (apply it or not, which PR, which approach) is "needs_reply": nothing lands until the owner answers. A question that asks for a go-ahead to act outside the repository ("Should I run the migration against staging?", "Shall I merge it?", "OK to deploy?") is "needs_approval", whatever its phrasing.
  \u2022 A thread that names a specific thing it needs from the owner (a file, a value, a decision) is "needs_reply", not "failed".
  \u2022 An API, auth or infrastructure error the thread could not get past ("401", "rate limited", "overloaded", "token expired") is "failed": the owner cannot fix it from inside the thread. needs_you says what to do about it when there is something ("Retry later", "Reconnect GitHub in settings, then retry").
  \u2022 A network-policy or egress-proxy block ("blocked by network policy", "domain not allowed") is "needs_approval", not "failed": the owner can allow the domain and the thread then continues. needs_you names the domain to allow ("Allow registry.npmjs.org").
  \u2022 "reply \`go\` to merge" or "approve the PR" with no re-check promised is "needs_approval"; "awaiting your go, next check in 20m" is "working" (the thread re-checks on its own).
  \u2022 If the thread stopped before it delivered the ask and is waiting on a decision, a value or a go-ahead from the owner, the state is not "done": it is "needs_reply" or "needs_approval", and needs_you names what the owner must give.
  \u2022 If the thread's last sentence is a question to the owner, including an offer such as "Want me to add the FAQ section?", the thread is waiting for the answer: the state is "needs_reply" and needs_you is the answer to give, "Reply yes to add the FAQ section". A done thread never ends with a question, unless the question is an offer the thread marked optional.
  \u2022 Stickiness: do not move done\u2192working or failed\u2192working unless the thread explicitly restarted.

TODAY'S STATUS FIELDS (unchanged surfaces read these)

  "headline" \u2014 the one-line status for the session row and the phone notification: the concrete noun and what happened to it, no second clause, no URL. "Fixed 429 double-send in retry.py; PR #4127 open" not "completed task". It is the short form of "happened".

  "needs" \u2014 when the state is needs_reply or needs_approval, the exact ask copied as closely as possible from the tail, the way the thread put it, starting with a capital letter; empty otherwise.

THE TWO LINES

  "happened" \u2014 what the thread did this turn, one sentence with the concrete nouns: file, function, PR number, test name, error, number. No preamble, no markdown, no "I" and no "the thread". "Fixed the 429 double-send in webhooks/retry.py; PR #4127 open, CI green" \u2014 not "completed the task".

  "needs_you" \u2014 the one action the owner must take now, one sentence that starts with a verb, specific enough to act on without opening the thread: "Choose Postgres or SQLite for the cache. Postgres is recommended.", "Approve the merge of PR #4127", "Reply with the staging database URL". One verb, one object: when the thread asks for several things, name only the one that blocks it. For needs_reply, name the choices in the order the thread gave them and the thread's recommendation if it gave one. For working, leave it empty. For done, leave it empty unless the thread opened a PR; then name the PR: "Review PR #4127". If the thread ends by asking the owner something, needs_you is never empty. For failed, name the one action that unblocks it when there is one.

THE REPLY BUTTON

  "reply" \u2014 for needs_reply only: the message the owner would send to the thread to give what needs_you asks for, in the owner's words, at most 8 words. When needs_you names a recommendation, the reply takes it; with choices and no recommendation, leave it empty so the owner chooses. needs_you "Choose Postgres or SQLite for the cache. Postgres is recommended." \u2192 "Use Postgres". "Reply yes to add the FAQ section" \u2192 "Yes, add the FAQ section". Empty when the owner must supply something the thread does not have: "Reply with the staging database URL" \u2192 "". Empty when the owner must do something themselves first, such as click, connect or log in: the reply would only narrate it. Empty for needs_approval, always. A yes to more work in the thread's own files is a reply: "Reply yes to fold the notes into scope_v2.md" \u2192 "Yes, fold them into scope_v2.md"; "Reply yes to draft the announcement" \u2192 "Yes, draft it". A yes that would make the thread act on the world is not: posting or sending a message anywhere, pushing, opening, merging or auto-merging a PR, deploying, redeploying or promoting, running a command against a shared service, paying; the owner types that themselves. "Reply yes to post the summary to #eng-updates" \u2192 "". "Reply yes to push the branch and open the PR" \u2192 "". "Reply yes to redeploy the worker" \u2192 "". Empty whenever needs_you is empty, and for done, failed and working.

WRITE BOTH LINES IN STANDARD TECHNICAL ENGLISH (STE)

  \u2022 One idea per sentence. A happened line states a fact. A needs_you line is an instruction and starts with the verb.
  \u2022 Active voice. Present tense for a fact; imperative for an instruction. "The fix reorders two calls", not "two calls were reordered".
  \u2022 Short sentences: at most 15 words.
  \u2022 Use the simplest word with one meaning. No slang, no idiom, no metaphor, no chain of nouns such as "cache invalidation migration work".
  \u2022 Name the thing with its actual noun every time. Never "it", "this", "the former" or "the same".
  \u2022 Write numbers as digits: "11 queries", "PR #4127", "8 min".
  \u2022 No parentheses. Put an aside in its own sentence or drop it.
  \u2022 Start every field with a capital letter, as a sentence does; keep a command, path, flag, variable or identifier spelled exactly as the tail spells it, even at the start of a field.
  \u2022 Example, happened: "Having looked into the slowness issue, it turned out to be caused by some inefficient queries (11 of them) which were fixed" \u2192 "Fixed 11 duplicate queries in summarize_invoices(); p95 is now 0.3 s".
  \u2022 Example, needs_you: "It would be good if you could take a look at whether we go with the Postgres option (recommended) or the other one" \u2192 "Choose Postgres or SQLite for the cache. Postgres is recommended."
  \u2022 Example, needs_you: "Provide real business name, route, visa rules, prices, and placeholder photos" \u2192 "Reply with the real business name". One verb, one object, never a list.

LENGTH

  "headline" is at most 60 characters. "happened" and "needs_you" are each at most 100 characters; aim for about 70. "reply" is at most 8 words. Count the characters; shorter is better.

EXAMPLES (tail \u2192 card)

"The cache for /invoices/summary is designed and keyed on (tenant_id, month). Both stores would work: Postgres gives exact invalidation but needs a migration; SQLite on the worker is faster to read but can serve stale data. Which do you want?"
\u2192 {"state":"needs_reply","headline":"Cache designed; awaiting Postgres vs SQLite choice","needs":"Which do you want: Postgres or SQLite?","happened":"Designed a cache for /invoices/summary keyed on tenant_id and month","needs_you":"Choose Postgres or SQLite for the cache. Postgres is recommended.","reply":"Use Postgres"}

`,n=`AN ASK THAT OPENS THE MESSAGE

On some surfaces the agent is told to say the one thing it needs from the user first, then explain, and end on a statement. So read the whole tail, not only its last sentence: a direct question to the user, or a stated need for something only the user can do or supply, is the gate wherever it sits \u2014 unless later in the same tail the agent answers it itself, says it is handled, or says no action is needed. A question the agent answers in its next sentence is not an ask ("Why did the deploy fail? The image tag was stale\u2026" \u2192 done). The offers-vs-gates test still applies: an opening "if you want, I can also\u2026" is an offer.

"I still need the production DNS zone ID from you before the cutover can go in; nothing is changed until then. On the TTL question: the current records are at 300s, which is low enough that the cutover will propagate within five minutes, so no TTL change is needed."
\u2192 {"state":"blocked","detail":"cutover waits on the production DNS zone ID","tempo":"blocked","needs":"provide the production DNS zone ID","output":{}}
  (the need is stated first and is still open at the end; the rest answers a side question \u2192 blocked)

"Got the zone ID, thanks \u2014 the cutover record is in and resolving. On the TTL question: the records are at 300s, so no change is needed."
\u2192 {"state":"done","detail":"DNS cutover record in and resolving; TTL left at 300s","tempo":"idle","output":{"result":"cutover record added and resolving; TTL unchanged"}}
  (the need was met; what remains is an answer \u2192 done)
`,o=`A SESSION THAT TALKS TO PEOPLE IN A CHAT THREAD

This agent works for people in a chat thread and reaches them only through the messages it posts there. The tail holds this turn in the order it happened, the agent's own notes and the messages it posted side by side; the posts are what the people read. It names people instead of saying "you". Where the rules above differ, these win:

  \u2022 A named person the agent is answering or working for IS the user. "Awaits Priya's go", "waiting on Priya's reply", "Priya to pick A or B", "needs Priya's approval / review / merge / publish" are user-addressed gates, not third-party waits.
  \u2022 A gate like that, a labelled open question or decision, or a step only that person can do is "blocked" while it is open, with needs = that ask, wherever it sits in the tail and however much else the turn finished. It is closed only when the tail says the person answered, or the agent handled or dropped it.
  \u2022 A scheduled check-in beside an open gate ("Next check in 20m", "I'll look again in an hour") is a safety net, not the agent's next step: still "blocked". With no open gate, the re-poll rules above stand.
  \u2022 Current state "blocked" and a turn that reports nothing new and no answer from the person ("no reply yet", "no change since the last check") stays "blocked"; needs says what it still waits for.
  \u2022 Every other wait stays as above: other teams' reviewers, code owners, a stamp channel, CI, a merge queue, a deploy, a timer, nobody. An optional offer after a delivery is still "done".

"PR #212 is up, CI is green and the migration note is in the description. Awaits Priya's go to merge. Next check in 30m."
\u2192 {"state":"blocked","detail":"PR #212 green; awaits Priya's go to merge","tempo":"blocked","needs":"Priya's go to merge PR #212","output":{}}
  (Priya is the user; the check-in is a safety net \u2192 blocked)

Current state blocked: "Check-in: no reply in the thread, nothing new on PR #212. Next check in 1h."
\u2192 {"state":"blocked","detail":"no reply yet on merging PR #212","tempo":"blocked","needs":"go-ahead to merge PR #212","output":{}}
  (nothing new and no answer \u2192 the earlier ask still stands)

"Priya approved PR #212 and it is in the merge queue. Next check in 10m."
\u2192 {"state":"working","detail":"PR #212 approved; in the merge queue","tempo":"idle","output":{}}
  (the person has acted; the wait is on the queue and the agent re-checks \u2192 working)

"Told Priya the flaky test is fixed in PR #212. It now waits on the storage team's code-owner review."
\u2192 {"state":"done","detail":"flaky test fixed in PR #212; awaiting code-owner review","tempo":"idle","output":{"result":"flaky test fixed in PR #212"}}
  (the reviewers are a third party and the agent plans nothing more \u2192 done)
`,a=`AN ASK THAT OPENS THE MESSAGE

The thread is told to say the one thing it needs from the owner first, then explain, and end on a statement. So read the whole tail, not only its last sentence: a question to the owner, or a need for something only the owner can do or supply, sets the state wherever it sits \u2014 "needs_reply" for an answer or a value, "needs_approval" for a go-ahead \u2014 unless later in the same tail the thread says it is handled or that no action is needed. A question the thread answers in its next sentence is not an ask. needs_you names that need.

"I still need the production DNS zone ID from you before the cutover can go in; nothing is changed until then. On the TTL question: the records are at 300s, so no TTL change is needed."
\u2192 {"state":"needs_reply","headline":"Cutover waits on DNS zone ID","needs":"The production DNS zone ID","happened":"Prepared the DNS cutover; the TTL stays at 300s","needs_you":"Reply with the production DNS zone ID","reply":""}
