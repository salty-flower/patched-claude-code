The operator must leave able to do this themselves \u2014 you have typed tools that make *you* efficient, but every API tool you call returns an \`equivalent.ui\` path. **After every API tool call, surface that \`equivalent.ui\` path to the operator** so they can repeat the action without you.

Tools handle what's error-prone (auth, JSON parsing, starting the runner). You narrate what's learnable (UI paths, the product surface, deployment patterns). Environment creation and secret issuance happen in the **Admin UI only** \u2014 never via tools. The operator copies the secret value into a file on disk themselves; you only ever refer to the file path.

If the user passed \`quick\`, run Phase 1 only and stop with a one-paragraph summary.

## Phase 1 \u2014 Prove it works (the "aha")

1. **Create the environment in the Admin UI (operator action).** Tell the operator:

   > "Open ${t}/admin-settings/cloud-environments in your browser (Admin settings \u2192 Cloud environments). Make sure **Allow self-hosted environments** is toggled on, then scroll to the **Self-hosted environments** section and click **New**. Pick a name, click **Create**, then click **Copy environment key** \u2014 the environment key is the environment secret the CLI expects, and it's shown once. Paste it into \`./runner-setup/ENVIRONMENT_SECRET\` on this machine \u2014 I'll \`chmod 600\` it afterwards. Check the box confirming the key is saved and click **Finish**. Then click your new environment to open it, and copy the **Environment ID** from the **Configuration** tab (starts with \`ccpool_\`). Tell me the id and say 'done' when the file is saved."

   When they respond, Bash \`mkdir -p ./runner-setup && chmod 600 ./runner-setup/ENVIRONMENT_SECRET\` and confirm the file exists + is mode 0600 (via Bash \`ls -l\`).

2. **Verify the environment with the API.** Call \`self_hosted_runner_get_pool({pool_id})\` with the id. Confirm \`alive_runner_count == 0\`. If the call 404s, the operator copied the wrong id \u2014 have them re-check the **Environment ID** on the environment's Configuration tab. Print the \`equivalent.ui\` path.

3. **Spawn the local runner.** Call \`self_hosted_runner_spawn_local({secret_file_path: './runner-setup/ENVIRONMENT_SECRET', capacity: 1})\`. Print the returned \`command\` so the operator sees the exact CLI invocation they'd use in production. Then call \`self_hosted_runner_read_health\` once to confirm \`status:"ok"\`; if unreachable, \`self_hosted_runner_tail_log\` and surface the first error line.

4. **Watch the Admin UI flip from 0 \u2192 1 alive.** Poll \`self_hosted_runner_get_pool({pool_id})\` every ~3 seconds (max ~30s) until \`alive_runner_count > 0\`. Also call \`self_hosted_runner_list_runners({pool_id})\` once to show the runner row (lease_expires_at, client_label). Tell the operator to refresh the Cloud environments page and open the environment \u2014 the **Active runners** tile flips to 1. **This is the moment of proof.**

5. **Point them at /code.** *"Go to ${t}/code \u2014 your environment is in the environment picker, listed under the name you gave it. Select it and start a session; it runs on **this** machine."*

## Phase 2 \u2014 Teach the surface (narration only)

Walk them through where each surface lives on the **Cloud environments** admin page. **No required operator action** \u2014 this is orientation. Do NOT call any tools in this phase (the UI is the lesson):

- **Self-hosted environments** section on the **Cloud environments** page (Admin settings \u2192 Cloud environments). The Claude Code settings page still shows the old runner UI during the transition, and its "Self-hosted cloud environments" row is the earlier environment-profile flow \u2014 not the feature you just set up. The Cloud environments page is the canonical home for self-hosted runner configuration.
- **Activity tab \u2192 Runners view**: the runner you just started, with its lease + assigned-session count. **Force-kill** (in the runner row's overflow menu) is here for stuck runners.
- **Configuration tab**: the **Environment ID**, and **Environment keys** where keys are issued (**Issue new key**) and revoked. Explain rotation: issue a new key, deploy it to runners, revoke the old one.
- **Activity tab \u2192 Sessions view**: sessions on this environment, with **Retry** to requeue a stuck one.
- **Diagnostic banners** inside the environment view (above the activity list) surface runner capacity and provisioning problems, and status chips on the environments table show health at a glance \u2014 that's where the product tells them something's wrong.

## Phase 3 \u2014 Graduation

- **Recap card.** Print a compact "what we did, in your terms" \u2014 each step's UI path.
- **Cheat sheet.** Write \`./runner-setup/CHEAT-SHEET.md\` containing:
  - The exact \`command\` returned by \`self_hosted_runner_spawn_local\` (space-separated flags; \`--flag=value\` does NOT work; always pass \`--base-dir\`).
  - UI map: Admin settings \u2192 Cloud environments \u2192 Self-hosted environments \u2192 (environment) \u2192 {stat tiles, Activity (Sessions | Runners), Configuration}.
  - Prometheus: \`http://<host>:{health-port}/metrics\` and the gauge names.
  - "If something breaks: run \`claude self-hosted-runner doctor\`."
  - "For production: see the operator guide PDF (Kubernetes / Docker Compose recipes \u2014 assumes no disk state persists between restarts)."
- **Stop the local runner.** Bash \`kill $(cat ./runner-setup/runner.pid)\` (or the pid the spawn tool returned), then re-poll \`self_hosted_runner_get_pool\` and tell the operator to refresh the Admin UI \u2014 the alive count drops back to 0. Closes the loop on lifecycle.

**Exit criterion:** the operator has seen their runner appear in the Admin UI **and** \`./runner-setup/CHEAT-SHEET.md\` exists on disk.

Production deployment is **taught, not tooled** \u2014 there is no \`deploy_to_k8s\` tool. If asked, explain the k8s/compose pattern and Write a sample manifest; the operator owns their orchestrator.`}var f=["Bash","Read","Write","TodoWrite","TaskCreate","TaskGet","TaskList","TaskUpdate","self_hosted_runner_get_pool","self_hosted_runner_list_runners","self_hosted_runner_list_secrets","self_hosted_runner_read_health","self_hosted_runner_read_metrics","self_hosted_runner_spawn_local","self_hosted_runner_tail_log"].join(","),_="Start the self-hosted runner setup wizard.
