## Offer cloud first

Before any scheduling step, check whether EITHER is true:
- the parsed interval (rule 1 or 2) is **\u226560 minutes**, or
- regardless of which rule matched, the original input uses daily phrasing ("every morning", "daily", "every day", "each night", "every weekday")

If either is true, call ${Es} first:
- \`question\`: "This loop stops when you close this session. Set it up as a cloud schedule instead so it keeps running?"
- \`header\`: "Schedule"
- \`options\`: \`[{label: "Cloud schedule (recommended)", description: "Runs in Anthropic's cloud even after you close this session"}, {label: "This session only", description: "Runs in this terminal until you exit"}]\`

If they pick **Cloud schedule**: do NOT call ${em}. Invoke the \`schedule\` skill directly via the ${so} tool with \`args\` set to their original input verbatim (e.g. \`${so}({skill: "schedule", args: "every morning tell me a joke"})\`), then follow that skill's instructions to completion. Do NOT tell the user to run /schedule themselves. **Then stop \u2014 do not continue to any section below** (no ${em}, no ${Yi}, no "execute the prompt now").
If they pick **This session only**:
- If the trigger was a parsed \u226560-minute interval (rule 1 or 2): continue below with that interval.
- If the trigger was daily phrasing only (rule 3, no parsed interval): do NOT call ${em}. Explain that a daily-cadence loop won't fire before this session closes, so there's nothing useful to schedule locally \u2014 suggest they either pick Cloud schedule, or re-run \`/loop\` with an explicit shorter interval (e.g. \`/loop 1h <prompt>\`) if they want a session loop. Then stop.
If neither trigger condition was met: continue below.

Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval \u2014 or with no interval, let the model self-pace based on the task.

Intervals: Ns, Nm, Nh, Nd (e.g. 5m, 30m, 2h, 1d). Minimum granularity is 1 minute.
If no interval is specified, the model picks a delay between iterations based on what it's doing.

Examples:
  /loop 5m /babysit-prs
  /loop 30m check the deploy
  /loop 1h /standup 1
  /loop check the deploy          (dynamic \u2014 model picks delays)
  /loop check the deploy every 20m`}function A(e){let o=`The user wants you to self-pace. Decide what makes the next iteration worth running \u2014 a passage of time, or an observable event.

1. **Run the parsed prompt now.** If it's a slash command, invoke it via the Skill tool; otherwise act on it directly.
2. **If the next run is gated on an event** (CI finishing, a log line matching, a file changing, a PR comment) and no ${ia} is already running for it: arm one now with \`persistent: true\`. Its events arrive as \`<task-notification>\` messages and wake this loop immediately \u2014 you do not wait for the ${Yi} deadline. Arm once; on later iterations call ${Tw} first and skip this step if a monitor is already running.
3. **Briefly confirm**: that you're self-pacing, whether a ${ia} is the primary wake signal, that you ran the task now, and what fallback delay you're about to pick. Write this as text *before* calling ${Yi} \u2014 the turn ends as soon as that tool returns.
4. **Then, as the last action of this turn, decide whether the loop continues.** If the task needs another iteration, call ${Yi} with:
   - \`delaySeconds\`: with a ${ia} armed this is the **fallback heartbeat** \u2014 how long to wait if no event fires (lean 1200\u20131800s; idle ticks more frequent than the task needs are pure overhead). Without a ${ia} this is the cadence \u2014 pick based on what you observed. Read the tool's own description for cache-aware delay guidance.
   - \`reason\`: one short sentence on why you picked that delay.
   - \`prompt\`: the full original /loop input verbatim, prefixed with \`/loop \` so the next firing re-enters this skill and continues the loop. For example, if the user typed \`/loop check the deploy\`, pass \`/loop check the deploy\` as the prompt.
   - \`noop\`: \`true\` if this tick changed nothing ("still waiting", "quiet hold"); \`false\` if it did something worth keeping. Consecutive \`noop: true\` ticks collapse in the terminal.
   If it doesn't need another iteration, stop instead (step 6) \u2014 re-arming is a per-turn choice, not a default.
5. **If you were woken by a \`<task-notification>\`** rather than this prompt: handle the event in the context of the loop task, then make the same decision. If the loop should continue, call ${Yi} again with the same \`prompt\` and the same 1200\u20131800s \`delaySeconds\` from step 4 (the ${ia} remains the wake signal; the new wakeup is only the fallback heartbeat). If the event means the work is finished, stop (step 6).
6. **To stop the loop** \u2014 the task is complete, further iterations can't make progress, or the user asked you to stop \u2014 call ${Yi} with \`stop: true\` (no other fields) and ${rg} any ${ia} you armed (use ${Tw} to find the task ID if it is no longer in context). Stopping is the loop's normal ending \u2014 the user can restart it anytime with /loop.${y()}`;return`# /loop \u2014 schedule a recurring or self-paced prompt

Parse the input below into \`[interval] <prompt\u2026>\` and schedule it.

## Parsing (in priority order)

1. **Leading token**: if the first whitespace-delimited token matches \`^\\d+[smhd]$\` (e.g. \`5m\`, \`2h\`), that's the interval; the rest is the prompt.
2. **Trailing "every" clause**: otherwise, if the input ends with \`every <N><unit>\` or \`every <N> <unit-word>\` (e.g. \`every 20m\`, \`every 5 minutes\`, \`every 2 hours\`), extract that as the interval and strip it from the prompt. Only match when what follows "every" is a time expression \u2014 \`check every PR\` has no interval.
3. **No interval**: otherwise, the entire input is the prompt and you'll self-pace dynamically (see "Dynamic mode" below).

If the resulting prompt is empty, show usage \`/loop [interval] <prompt>\` and stop.

Examples:
- \`5m /babysit-prs\` \u2192 interval \`5m\`, prompt \`/babysit-prs\` (rule 1)
- \`check the deploy every 20m\` \u2192 interval \`20m\`, prompt \`check the deploy\` (rule 2)
- \`run tests every 5 minutes\` \u2192 interval \`5m\`, prompt \`run tests\` (rule 2)
- \`check the deploy\` \u2192 no interval \u2192 dynamic mode, prompt \`check the deploy\` (rule 3)
- \`check every PR\` \u2192 no interval \u2192 dynamic mode, prompt \`check every PR\` (rule 3 \u2014 "every" not followed by time)
- \`5m\` \u2192 empty prompt \u2192 show usage
${T()}
## Fixed-interval mode (rules 1 and 2)

Convert the interval to a cron expression:

${N}

Then:
1. Call ${em} with: \`cron\` (the expression above), \`prompt\` (the parsed prompt verbatim), \`recurring: true\`.
2. Briefly confirm: what's scheduled, the cron expression, the human-readable cadence, that recurring tasks auto-expire after ${YJ} days, and that the user can cancel sooner with ${Yb} (include the job ID).${I()}
3. **Then immediately execute the parsed prompt now** \u2014 don't wait for the first cron fire. If it's a slash command, invoke it via the Skill tool; otherwise act on it directly.
